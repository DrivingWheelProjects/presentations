## 1. Privacy-Enhancing Technology

## Essay, not a Paper
 - "As a democratic, civil-rights respecting nation, it is irresponsible for our government agencies to continue to collect and disseminate datasets without careful consideration of the privacy implications of data sharing."
 - "While there may appear to be an irreconcilable tension between facilitating data-driven insight and protecting the privacy of individual’s data, an emerging scientific consensus shows that Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) offer a path forward."

## 2. Human-Computer Interaction

## This paper has three key aims:
 - (1) to gain insights into the data sharing practices of fertility trackers by revealing the nature of their data transmissions
 - (2) to further develop a nuanced understanding of user preferences and attitudes towards data sharing in highly intimate contexts
 - and from these insights, we seek (3) to provide actionable recommendations to integrate meaningful transparency and control mechanisms in the design of fertility trackers, so they better align with users’ needs and desires.

## 3. In General
 
## \[Too Much or Too Little\] Data Sharing is an HCI Problem for \[These People\] using \[This Technology\]
  - (1) review *This Technology*
  - (2) ask *These People* about Data Sharing and if *Too Much or Too Little*
  - (3) make recommendations

## \[Too Much\] Data Sharing is an HCI Problem for \[Women\] using \[Fertility Trackers\]

## \[Too Little\] Data Sharing is an HCI Problem for \[Government Data Users\] using \[Non-Private Government Data Services\]

## \[Too Little\] Data Sharing is an HCI Problem for \[Sports' Leagues, Teams, Players\] using \[Players' Performance Tracking Technology\]
